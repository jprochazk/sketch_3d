3D enviroment

uses trigonometry to change velocity in X and Y directions depending on the angle, effectively creating 
the effect that the player is moving in the direction it is looking:

velocity X = speed*sin(<angle in radians>)
velocity Y = speed*cos(<angle in radians>)

the player rotation and camera rotation are separate, creating a 3rd person point of view
